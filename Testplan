1.check that we can parse the instruction into the tag, index and byte select
   address bits = 32
   Number of byte select bits = 6
   Number of index bits = 21 (capacity bits minus associativity minus byte select bits)
   Number of tag bits = 5
   
2.check that the miss turns into a hit when using the same instruction (with different byte selects)

3.check that the LRU updates correctly
   0 - Move Right, 1 - Move Left
   
4.check that we can select the correct one to evict
   0 - Move Left, 1- Move Right
   
5.check that mesi updates correctly
   for the MESI protocol, we will have
   00 = invalid
   01 = exclusive
   10 = shared
   11 = modified
   
6. enter differing instructions to test the miss and hits, and make sure it all works together.
